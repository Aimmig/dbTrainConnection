#To-Do Stuff:

-If possible make colums resizable and auto-streched on resize
-Add specific informations on Error handling, networkConnection, internalServerProblem (no data) etc..
-Add functionality to (re)-request map if markerColor, pathColor change
-Remove size of map in gui, instead configure this in config + option to increase/decrease a fixed percentage from menu

-Remove duplicate methods for formatting colors with #, move these methods to class where they are used and pass color as
argument
