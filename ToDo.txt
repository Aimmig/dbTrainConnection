#To-Do Stuff:

-If possible make colums resizable and auto-streched on resize
-Add specific informations on Error handling, networkConnection, internalServerProblem (no data) etc..
-Add functionality to (re)-request map if maptype, or markerColor, pathColor
-Remove button for requesting now, instead set actual time and day in calenderPicker/timePicker (DONE!)
-Refactor code accordingly and remove functions that are no longer needed
