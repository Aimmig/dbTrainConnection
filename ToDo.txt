#To-Do Stuff:

-If possible make colums resizable and auto-streched on resize
-Translate all Gui elements to English/German
-Add specific informations on Error handling, networkConnection, internalServerProblem (no data) etc..
-Implement some sort of possibility to save the requested data local into a file
  ->(this might not be good practice (see API, because the Id's etc. might not be consistent)
-Integrate some more options(?) into QMenuBar
-Seperate Settings class into 2 subclasses (request and other)
