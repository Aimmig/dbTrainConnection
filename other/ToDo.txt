#To-Do Stuff:


-If possible make colums resizable and auto-streched on resize
-Add specific informations on Error handling, networkConnection, internalServerProblem (no data) etc..
-Add functionality to (re)-request map if markerColor, pathColor change
-Remove size of map in gui, instead configure this in config + option to increase/decrease a fixed percentage from menu


- Completly migrate to mapbox as described in mapbox.txt
   -> use the corresponding styles as defined in documentation
   -> for path use polyline encoding
