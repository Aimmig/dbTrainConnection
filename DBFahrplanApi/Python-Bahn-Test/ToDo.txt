#To-Do Stuff:

-If possible make colums resizable and auto-streched on resize.
-Read into google maps static api and request map with all the stops
-Maybe use some more options from googel maps api for displaying the map?
-Create Classes for QConnectionTable and QDetailTable that set all the properites in the constructors,
 so that constructor of own gui is cleaner
-Add variable to class connection that stores raw image data so that the image is only requested once
